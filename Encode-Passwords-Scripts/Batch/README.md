# Encode-Password-Batchfile
#### Encode Password in batch file (.bat). A possible way to encode passwords in a batch file and not display in plain text passwords

It is not an encryption but rather an encoding (not precisely in Base64), it is a way not to set password in plain text in a batch file .bat script. Obfuscating a password within the code of a script, it is not safe! but it may be better if the password is in plain text format.
